✅ **<ins>Task 10 (Sub-Agents System Completed)**</ins>

🤖 **Agents Built**

**Agent	Role**
*Orchestrator Agent	Main controller,coordinates workflow between all agents.
*Research Agent	Handles fact-checking,data gathering and references.
*Writing Agent	Generates chapters using outlines + character data.
*Editing Agent Enhances clarity,grammar,style and consistency.
*Formatting Agent	Prepares final manuscript in professional format.

🔄 **<ins>Workflow Architecture**</ins>

**Planning → Research → Writing → Editing → Formatting**

📡 <ins>Agent-to-Agent Integration</ins>

•	Sub-agents reuse the Skill System (Task 9)

•	Orchestrator manages sequencing and task delegation

•	JSON-based communication for consistent data exchange

•	Clear protocols for task execution and feedback loops
